Just when you think Night City can't get any more fucked, the **Red Chrome Legion** shows up to prove that rock bottom has a basement, chooms.

So there I was, still processing the data from the Forlorn Hope inferno, when my surveillance feeds light up with fresh nightmare fuel. The smoke's barely cleared, injured survivors are getting patched up by good samaritans, and what rolls up like the world's shittiest cavalry?

**Three Red Chrome dickheads in a rust-bucket pickup, ready to vulture-feed on tragedy.**

## ‚ùñ Scavengers Gonna Scav

Picture this clusterfuck: The Hope's still smoldering, people are coughing up smoke and nursing burns, and these chrome-cosplay rejects see **opportunity** instead of human suffering.

<strong>EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE:</strong><br>
"RedChrome_Vultures_BTFO.mp4" ‚Äî <em>Watch three wannabe patriots get schooled by professionals who actually give a shit about people.</em>
</div>

The video's got it all: Red Chrome idiots rolling up slow, thinking they're about to score easy pickings from defenseless victims. What they didn't count on? The same edgerunner crew that just pulled everyone out of the fire wasn't going anywhere.

## ‚ùñ Professional vs. Pathetic

Here's where it gets beautiful, choombas. The moment those Legion losers step out of their mobile scrap heap with weapons drawn, the edgerunners go **full professional**:

**0:15** - Solo drops smoke grenades, creating instant cover for the injured<br>
**0:23** - Netrunner starts frying the Legion's comms with cutting digital insults<br>
**0:34** - Team medic keeps working on casualties while calling out tactical positions<br>
**0:42** - Suppression fire that's surgical‚Äîwarning shots that say "fuck around and find out"

Meanwhile, the Red Chrome "warriors"? One trips over his own boots, another can't figure out which end of his iron shoots bullets, and the third keeps yelling about "patriotic duty" while hiding behind a dumpster.

<strong>COMBAT ANALYSIS:</strong><br>
‚Ä¢ Edgerunners: Coordinated, professional, protective<br>
‚Ä¢ Red Chrome: Confused, cowardly, completely outclassed<br>
‚Ä¢ Civilian casualties: ZERO (thanks to actual heroes)<br>
‚Ä¢ Legion casualties: Pride and dignity (what little they had)

## ‚ùñ Heroes vs. Zeros

The beautiful part? The edgerunners held that line until every single injured person got clear. Smoke, bullets, and stone-cold competence against three mouth-breathing scavengers who thought tragedy was a shopping opportunity.

By the time Trauma Team arrived, the Legion losers had already retreated to whatever hole they crawled out of, probably to brag about how they "showed those runners who's boss" while conveniently forgetting the part where they got absolutely humiliated.

---

The message is crystal clear, Night City: When the chips are down and the smoke clears, you'll know who the real heroes are. **Hint: It's not the assholes with red paint jobs and patriotic delusions.**

---

Shoutout to those edgerunners who proved that chrome's just metal‚Äîit's what you do with it that counts.
