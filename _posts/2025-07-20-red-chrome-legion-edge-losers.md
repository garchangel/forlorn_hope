Hot off the feeds, chooms—this one’s extra cringe. The **Red Chrome Legion**, those wannabe chromed-out “patriots” with more synthleather than sense, have officially hit rock bottom... and started to dig.

Your boy Feed just scored the hottest video byte on the DataPool: a pack of RCL goons “patrolling” the Combat Zone, looking for someone weaker than their collective IQ. They spot a homeless solo, all patched up and just minding their biz. Cue the shaky cam as four Legionnaires try to “prove their strength” by jumping the guy.

Except—get this—they get absolutely dumpstered. One chummer whiffs a punch so hard he nearly flatlines himself on a dumpster lid. Another drops his iron, fumbles for it, and gets a boot to his chromeplated ass.

By the end? The “Red Chrome” looks more like “Red Bruise,” and the only thing “Legion” about them is the number of memes this vid’s gonna spawn.

<strong>BONUS BYTE:</strong><br>
[DATASTREAM: “RCL Beatdown.mp4” — <em>Watch Legionnaires get outclassed by a dude wearing a poncho made of trash bags. 30 seconds in and you’ll be howling louder than their squad leader’s sobs.</em>]

Night City’s verdict? The only thing these clowns are leading is the race to the bottom. Seriously, RCL, next time you wanna flex, maybe start with someone who can’t benchpress more than your entire crew.

Stay tuned, Night City, and remember:<br>
<strong>Mess with the meek, get rekt by the streets.</strong>
