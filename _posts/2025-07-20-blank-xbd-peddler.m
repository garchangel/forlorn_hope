Yo, chooms—**Feed** here, your plug into the underbelly of the feedstream, and today I’m coming at you with the digital dirt on Night City’s absolute bottom-feeder: **Blank**, the XBD slinger who’s turning braindance into a biohazard.

---

## ❖ Jack In, Get Burned

Let’s set the scene: you jack into Blank’s “premium” warehouse for a quick XBD trip, hoping for a little simulated chrome-fueled euphoria. Instead, you jack out with your neuralware screaming and your junk falling off IRL. 

Turns out, Blank’s been bootlegging braindances laced with the newest hotness—**hyper-Syphilis**, a glitchy, nano-augmented STD that turns your synapses into swiss cheese and your crotch into a walking CDC warning.

## ❖ Gutterware & Dirty Decks

Not only is Blank’s stock pure gutterware, but the choom can’t even keep his rigs clean. Rumor on the Datapool says he swaps recording decks with Joytoys down at the **Totentanz**, wipes ‘em with a dirty sock, and calls it *“sanitized.”*

If you’re lucky, you just wake up with a rash. If you’re not, your next braindance is a visit to the **Ripperdoc’s** for a full systems purge—hope you got platinum Trauma Team, choomba.

NetWatch is already sniffing around, but in the meantime, do yourself a favor:

<strong>DON’T SLOTT BLANK’S XBDs.</strong>  
Unless you like your brain scrambled and your bits infected.

Stay sharp, stay sanitized, and always check your sources.
